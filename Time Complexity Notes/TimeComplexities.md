# Below I've listed the most common time complexities from best to worst with their associated Big O representations

- ** YOU WANT TO BE SOMEWHERE IN THIS RANGE **
- Constant Time --> O(1) --> Always reduces down to O(1), example would be O(8) still represented as O(1) with Big O.

- Logarithmic Time --> O(logN) --> Time to completion reduced as input is traversed.

- Linear Time --> O(n) --> Time to completion directly linear as algorithm input size scales up.
- ** END ACCEPTABLE RANGE **
- Logarithmic time 'n' times --> O(nLog(n)) --> O(logN) operations 'n' times.

- Exponential time --> O(n^2) --> Time to complete will grow exponentionally as input size scales upward (bad news).

## There are even worse potential time complexities in front of exponential, while not as common, still important to know.

- O(2N) --> Exponential time multiplied any number of times, very bad.

- O(n!) --> O(n) factorial.
