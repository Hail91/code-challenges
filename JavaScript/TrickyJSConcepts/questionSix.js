console.log(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3); // => False

// In binary (or base-2), the only prime factor is 2, so you can only cleanly express fractions whose denominator has only 2 as a prime factor.
// In binary, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 would all be expressed cleanly as decimals, while 1/5 or 1/10 would be repeating decimals.
// So 0.1 and 0.2 (1/10 and 1/5), while clean decimals in a base-10 system, are repeating decimals in the base-2 system the computer uses.
// When you perform math on these repeating decimals, you end up with leftovers which carry over when you convert the computerâ€™s base-2 (binary) number into a more human-readable base-10 representation.
